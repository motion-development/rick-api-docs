# Errors

Our API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our servers.

We may also return errors in the JSON responses, which will follow the `message` and `description` format. The `message` usually just contains the `HTTP` error code, and the `description` contains a more detailed description of the error.

For some endpoints, such as **oauth2**, we follow the payload format errors in the `error` and `error_description` format, where `error` is an error key and `error_description` is a description of the error.

## Oauth2 Errors

When using the OAuth2 service, you may encounter the following errors when the user is redirected back to your application:

| Error                         | Description                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `invalid_request`             | The OAuth URL was malformed and the `error_description` will contain more information |
| `unsupported_response_type`   | The response type is not supported by the server                                      |

The following errors may be returned when exchanging a code for an access token. For most of them, the `error_description` will contain more information about the error.
